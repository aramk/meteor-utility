meteor-utility
==============

A collection of utility modules for Meteor.

## Future Development
* Parts of this library are converted from [utility](http://bitbucket.org/mutopia/utility) into
CoffeeScript, while parts are Meteor specific. It would be best to depend on that library and
add only the additional Meteor utilities.
* Add tests.
